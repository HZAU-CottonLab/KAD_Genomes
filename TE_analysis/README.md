### Description

##### Source data and code in the analysis of TE for *Gossypium rotundifolium* (K2), *G. arboreum* (A2) and *G. raimondii* (D5) species.

##### Full-length_LTR family        	  	 # Clustering of Full-length LTR  among three genome

##### Full-length_LTRs time     		  	 #  Burst time of Full-length LTR among three genome

##### Gorge3_Tree                             		 # Goge3 tree among three Gossypium species and Gossypioides kirkii   

##### Insertion_Time         						# Species-specific and conserved TAD among three genomes

##### Intergenic_Distance         			  #  The nearest TE distance of the gene
